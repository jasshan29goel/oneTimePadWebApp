<li>Â Prove that if only a single character is encrypted, then the shift cipher is perfectly secret.</li>
<li>What is the largest plaintext space M you can find for which the
mono-alphabetic substitution cipher provides perfect secrecy? (Note: M
need not contain only valid English words.)<br>

t so that perfect secrecy is obtained (Note: you can choose the length
of the key).</li>
