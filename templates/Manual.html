STEP 1: Select a plain text and a key by clicking on the Next buttons
next to the respective fields.<br><br>
				STEP 2: If the generated key is biased, make it unbiased in 0 and 1, and use it. You can use the idea given in theory part.<br><br>
STEP 3: On clicking on "Encrypt" button, you will get the ciphertext
for the same encryption scheme. You can get the cipher text for as many
plaintext and key pairs as you like for the same encryption scheme. You
can change the encryption scheme too if you want.<br><br>
STEP 4: You can take a look at all the possible 2^(length of plaintext
+ length of key) tuples of plaintext, key and ciphertext in the next
block.<br><br>
STEP 5: By observing the tuples obtained above, you need to tell if the
encryption scheme being used is secure or not. If not, you need to find
the message, m and ciphertext, c such that P(M=m|C=c) = P(M=m). In the
experiment the size of the message space and that of the key space are
equal. Thus from Shannon's theorem, to show that a scheme is not
perfect, it is enough if you locate two distinct plaintexts that are
encrypted to obtain the same ciphertext for the same keyÂ  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
